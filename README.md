# Keymap-editor
The keymap can be edited using the keymap-editor tool: https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/

Do note: In the default setup for this repo, the keymap for revision D will be edited. To use this tool for revision B-C, simply move that keymap-file to the /config-folder and delete the current revision D keymap file.
